  <h1>Realtime Test Server</h1>

  <h2>New Extensions</h2>
  <p>As of version 1.7, we have created two new extensions <b>ws.js</b> and <b>sse.js</b> to support realtime development in htmx.  All new effort on WebSockets and Server Sent Events will occur in these extensions.</p>

  <h2>Old Tags Deprecated</h2>
  <p>The existing <b>hx-ws</b> and <b>hx-sse</b> tags have been deprecated and will not receive any more updates.  We plan to remove these two tags from the core library in htmx version 2.0.</p>

  <h2>Try It For Yourself</h2>
  <p>Because extensions use a different calling syntax, there are minor differences in the way that this new code is invoked.  This test server includes several demos / manual tests for each extension that you can try out for yourself.  Each is presented side-by-side with test cases for the original code so that you can see the difference.</p>
